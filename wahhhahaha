/** Explanation:
    This code takes input from the user to get their grades on Java, C and Database.
    The if statements will check if the average is greater than or equal to the required grade to get an A, B, C and F grade
    then it puts a value to the "int grade" depending on what average grade they got. The switch statement will check the "int grade" 
    and uses the case depending on what number the "int grade" and executes the code corresponding to the case no.
